;; Meme Engine Manager Contract
;;
;; This contract is a core component of the Charisma protocol, designed to coordinate
;; and manage multiple meme engines. It provides centralized control over shared
;; parameters and functionality used by all meme engines in the ecosystem.
;;
;; Key Responsibilities:
;; 1. Threshold Management: Maintains and updates thresholds for balance integral calculations.
;; 2. Sample Point Generation: Provides functions to generate sample points for energy calculations.
;; 3. Authorization Control: Ensures only authorized entities can modify critical parameters.
;;
;; Core Components:
;; - Thresholds: Configurable parameters that determine the number of sample points for calculations.
;; - Sample Point Generation: Functions for 2, 5, 9, 19, and 39-point calculations.
;; - Authorization: Utilizes Dungeon Master contract for access control.
;;
;; Key Functions:
;; - Threshold Management: set-threshold-X-point functions to update thresholds.
;; - Sample Point Generation: generate-sample-points-X functions for various calculation resolutions.
;; - Threshold Retrieval: get-thresholds function to retrieve current threshold values.
;;
;; Security Features:
;; - Authorization checks using Dungeon Master contract.
;; - Validation of threshold values to maintain logical consistency.
;;
;; Integration with Charisma Ecosystem:
;; - Works in conjunction with meme engines to provide consistent calculation parameters.
;; - Interacts with Dungeon Master for authorization checks.
;;
;; Usage in Charisma:
;; 1. Threshold Updates: Authorized entities can adjust calculation thresholds as needed.
;; 2. Meme Engine Calculations: Engines use this contract to generate sample points for energy calculations.
;; 3. Protocol Governance: Allows centralized management of key parameters affecting all meme engines.
;;
;; This contract is crucial for maintaining consistency and efficiency across all meme engines
;; in the Charisma protocol. By centralizing threshold management and sample point generation,
;; it ensures that all engines operate under the same parameters, simplifying governance and
;; reducing the potential for discrepancies in energy calculations across different engines.
