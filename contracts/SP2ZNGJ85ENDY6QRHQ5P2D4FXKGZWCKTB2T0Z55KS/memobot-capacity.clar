;; Memobot Capacity Contract
;;
;; This contract manages the energy storage capacity for users within the Charisma protocol.
;; It dynamically calculates and enforces maximum energy limits based on a user's Memobot ownership.
;;
;; Key Features:
;; 1. Dynamic Capacity Calculation: Computes max energy capacity based on base storage and Memobot count
;; 2. Capacity Enforcement: Provides a function to cap energy amounts to user's maximum capacity 
;; 3. Memobot Integration: Increases energy capacity for users who own Memobots
;; 4. Configurable Parameters: Allows contract owner to adjust base storage and per-Memobot energy bonus
;;
;; Core Components:
;; - Base Energy Storage: A foundational amount of energy storage available to all users (100 energy)
;; - Energy per Memobot: Additional energy storage granted for each Memobot (+10 energy per Memobot)
;; - Max Capacity Calculation: Combines base storage with Memobot bonuses for total capacity
;; - Capacity Application: Ensures energy amounts don't exceed capacity while maintaining minimum gains
;;
;; Integration with Charisma Ecosystem:
;; - Interacts with Memobot contract to retrieve user's Memobot balance
;; - Enforces energy limits while providing informative feedback messages
;; - Ensures minimum energy gain of 1 unit even at capacity
;;
;; Key Functions:
;; - get-max-capacity: Calculates a user's maximum energy capacity
;; - apply: Caps energy gain to capacity while providing feedback messages
;; - set-energy-per-memobot: Owner function to adjust energy bonus per Memobot
;; - set-base-energy-storage: Owner function to adjust base energy storage
;;
;; Security Features:
;; - Contract owner authorization for admin functions
;; - Safe arithmetic operations with overflow checking
;; - Graceful handling of capacity limits
;;
;; User Feedback:
;; - Provides contextual messages about capacity status
;; - Informs users about Memobot benefits
;; - Encourages Memobot acquisition for increased capacity
;;
;; This contract plays a crucial role in the Charisma protocol by managing energy limits,
;; incentivizing Memobot ownership, and ensuring fair energy distribution while providing
;; clear feedback to users about their capacity status and options for improvement.
