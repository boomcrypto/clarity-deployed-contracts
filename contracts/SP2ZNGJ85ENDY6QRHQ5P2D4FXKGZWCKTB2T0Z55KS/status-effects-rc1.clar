;; Status Effects Contract
;;
;; This contract serves as the central modification layer for token operations in the
;; Charisma protocol. It intercepts token operations and applies various modifications
;; based on protocol conditions, NFT ownership, achievements, and other states.
;;
;; Architecture:
;; The contract follows a middleware pattern, where all token operations from the
;; Dungeon Keeper pass through this contract before execution. Each operation type
;; (reward, punish, energize, etc.) has its own modification function that applies
;; relevant effects.
;;
;; Key Components:
;; 1. Experience Modifications:
;;    - modify-reward: Adjusts experience rewards
;;    - modify-punish: Adjusts experience penalties
;;
;; 2. Energy Modifications:
;;    - modify-energize: Applies energy generation bonuses and capacity limits
;;    - modify-exhaust: Adjusts energy consumption
;;
;; 3. DMG Token Modifications:
;;    - modify-transfer: Applies transfer modifications (e.g., Raven reductions)
;;    - modify-burn: Applies burn modifications
;;    - modify-lock/unlock: Handles token locking modifications
;;
;; Integration Points:
;; - Energetic Welsh (.energetic-welsh): NFT-based energy generation bonuses
;; - Raven Resistance (.raven-resistance): Burn reduction calculations
;; - Energy Capacity (.energy-capacity): Maximum energy limits
;;
;; Modification Order:
;; The order of modifications is crucial for correct calculation:
;; 1. Base amount retrieved from context
;; 2. NFT-based modifications applied (e.g., Energetic Welsh)
;; 3. Protocol-wide limits applied (e.g., Energy Capacity)
;; 4. Final amount returned with modified target if applicable
;;
;; All functions in this contract are read-only to ensure deterministic behavior
;; and prevent state changes during modification calculations. The actual token
;; operations are performed by the Dungeon Keeper after modifications are applied.
;;
;; Usage:
;; This contract should never be called directly by users. Instead, it's called
;; by the Dungeon Keeper contract before executing any token operations. This ensures
;; all token operations in the protocol consistently apply the same modifications.
