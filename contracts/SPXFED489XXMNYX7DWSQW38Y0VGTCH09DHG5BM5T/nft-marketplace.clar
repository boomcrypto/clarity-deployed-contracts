;; A tiny NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale. They can specify the following:
;; - The NFT token to sell.
;; - Listing expiry in block height.
;; - The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
;; - The NFT price in said payment asset.
;; - An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.
