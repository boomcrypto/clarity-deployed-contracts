;; Synopsis:
;; This proposal outlines a significant change to mining and block validation 
;; that will make the Stacks blockchain faster and more reliable.
;; Description:
;; The document outlines a significant change to the Stacks blockchain, 
;; known as the "Nakamoto" release. This change would uncouple Stacks block 
;; production from miner elections, allowing miners to produce blocks at a 
;; set pace. The PoX Stackers, instead of miner elections, would determine 
;; the transition from one miner to another. A fork in this blockchain would 
;; require a 70% approval from the Stackers, making it as challenging to 
;; reorganize as the Bitcoin blockchain. This update would mark a major version 
;; jump for Stacks, from version 2 to 3. This represents a considerable 
;; architectural shift in how the Stacks blockchain operates, aiming for enhanced 
;; speed and reliability.
