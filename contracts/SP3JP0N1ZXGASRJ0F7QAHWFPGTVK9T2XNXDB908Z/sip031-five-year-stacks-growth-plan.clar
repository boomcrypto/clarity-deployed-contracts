;; Title: SIP-031: Five-Year Stacks Growth Emissions
;; Author(s): Alex Miller, Andre Serrano, Dylan Floyd, Jakob Schillinger, Mitchell Cuevas
;; and Tycho Onnasch
;; Synopsis:
;; SIP-031 proposed the creation of a growth-focused Stacks Endowment and streamlined 
;; ecosystem structure.
;; Description:
;; The proposed Treasury and updated ecosystem structure will bring Stacks from its foundational 
;; tech stage into a critical new phase of traction and growth. The treasury is funded by ongoing 
;; token emissions over the next five years and strategic seed STX transfers from core contributors. 
;; With new capital, professional treasury management, and clear organizational framework, this SIP 
;; allows for targeted user and builder incentives, accelerated core development, new marketing 
;; and liquidity efforts, community grant programs, additional business development resources, and 
;; more. Each aspect of this SIP is designed to address historical learnings and challenges while 
;; equipping the ecosystem with the tools needed to fuel growth, widespread adoption, and ensure 
;; that Stacks thrives as the leading Bitcoin layer-2 for decades to come.
