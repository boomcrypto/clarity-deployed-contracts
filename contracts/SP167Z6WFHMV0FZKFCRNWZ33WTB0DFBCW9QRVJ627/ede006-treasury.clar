;; Title: EDE006 Treasury
;; Author: Marvin Janssen
;; Depends-On:
;; Synopsis:
;; A treasury that can manage STX, SIP009, SIP010, and SIP013 tokens.
;; Description:
;; An extension contract that is meant to hold tokens on behalf of the
;; DAO. It can hold and transfer STX, SIP009, SIP010, and SIP013 tokens.
;; They can be deposited by simply transferring them to the contract.
;; Any extension or executing proposal can trigger transfers.
;; Technically, the ExecutorDAO core can hold and transfer tokens
;; directly. The treasury extension merely adds a bit of separation.
