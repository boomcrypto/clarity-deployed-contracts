;; Title: DME003 Emergency Proposals
;; Author: Ross Ragsdale
;; Depends-On: DME001
;; Synopsis:
;; This extension allows for the creation of 
;; emergency proposals by a few trusted principals.
;; Description:
;; Emergency proposals have a voting period of roughly 1 day, instead of the
;; normal proposal duration. Only a list of trusted principals, designated as the
;; "emergency team", can create emergency proposals. The emergency proposal
;; extension has a ~3 month sunset period, after which no more emergency
;; proposals can be made. The emergency team members, sunset period, and 
;; emergency vote duration can be changed by means of a future proposal.
