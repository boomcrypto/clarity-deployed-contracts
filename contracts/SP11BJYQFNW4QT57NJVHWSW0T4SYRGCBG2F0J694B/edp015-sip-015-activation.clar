;; Synopsis: This proposal outlines a set of updates to three major areas of the Stacks blockchain:
;; Stacking, Clarity, and block validation.
;; Description: Stacks 2.1 is a network-wide upgrade that aims to strengthen the 
;; connection between Stacks and Bitcoin. The upgrade is designed to bring improvements 
;; to stacking and proof-of-transfer, Clarity functionality, bridges, decentralized 
;; mining pools, and more. Should this upgrade pass, stakeholders of the Stacks network 
;; can ideally expect more efficient Bitcoin yield via Stacking, more robust bridges 
;; to other networks, improvements to developers' ability to trigger interactions 
;; between Stacks and Bitcoin, and fundamental groundwork laid for Subnets, which will 
;; increase speed and scalability.
