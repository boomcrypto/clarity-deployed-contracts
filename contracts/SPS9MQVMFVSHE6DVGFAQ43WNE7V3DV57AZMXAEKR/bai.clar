;; Title: BTC collateralized stable coin (DAI/MKR for BTC)
;; Author: Tim Parsa
;; Synopsis: BAI is to DAI as BTC is to ETH and AIR is to MKR.
;; Description: 
;; It's time to build a decentralized collateralized stablecoin 
;; on BTC using STX smart contracts. With operation 
;; chokepoint 2.0, the death of localbitcoins.com, and the 
;; crackdown on BTC/fiat rails, a DAI equivalent for 
;; BTC is an idea whose time has come 
;; and one that pairs nicely with other projects 
;; I've built, including the Air Protocol (chain agnostic 
;; protocol for crypto/fiat exchange).  I'd like to 
;; just copy pasta Maker's OSS solidity code to 
;; clarity and then do a fair start for 
;; earning Air.
